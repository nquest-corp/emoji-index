# emoji-index

This is a lightweight extension to the excellent emoji library (Link TBD) that provides a simple index / traversal of emoji characters to assist with selection menus.

## Known Limitations

Multi-person grouping emojis are not supported, as these require special handling that is at the moment out of scope. (https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#MultiPersonGroupingsTable)

Additionally, hair component modifiers are not presently supported. (https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#hair_components)
